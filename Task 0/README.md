# Installing Ubuntu OS as a dual boot
So, this task was about installing Ubuntu in my local system. I was intending to keep both Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux and hence I used dual boot. I downloaded the Ubuntu .iso image from this [website] (https://ubuntu.com/download) . I watched some youtube tutorials to download successfully and I ended up successfully dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 10.
